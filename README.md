# Intro-to-python

- Python has been around for thirty years and has seen a consistent rise in popularity.
- Unlike JavaScript, Python is praised for its elegance and consistency in syntax.
- Python is not just for beginners; it is used in developing complex systems due to its ability to handle complexity effectively.
- The "import this" statement serves as a hidden mission statement, emphasizing Python's focus on simplicity and readability.
- To access the Python command prompt, open a terminal and type "Python", where three greater-than symbols indicate readiness to accept Python code.

How to create a python program 
-----------------------------------
- Create a new file named "hello.py" with the .py extension.
- Add the following single line of Python code to print "Hello, World!": print('Hello, World!')
- Use single quotes to enclose the text string.
- Add a comment using the hash symbol (#) to remind yourself or other programmers about the purpose of the line of code.
- Comments serve as helpful explanations for code functionality.
- Save the file before proceeding.
- Navigate to the terminal or command prompt.
- Use the "cd" command to change directory to where the file is stored.
- Run the "hello.py" program using the command "python hello.py".
- Alternatively, type "h" and tab for autocomplete if the file name is unique.
- Upon running the program, the text "Hello, World!" will be printed to the screen.

Jupyter Notebooks
----------------------
- <b>Jupyter Notebooks:</b> Utilized for programming work in the course.
- <b>Project Jupyter:</b> A non-profit organization developing Python tools.
- <b>Jupyter Notebook:</b> Web application allowing writing and executing Python code in the browser.
- <b>Launching:</b> Initiated from the command line, it starts a web application server, opening in the browser automatically.
- <b>File Structure</b>: Shows a list of files, with ipynb files indicating Jupyter Notebook files.
- <b>Notebook Usage:</b> Popular for data science, presenting findings, creating charts, and sharing results.
- <b>Creating Notebooks:</b> Click "new" then select "Python 3" to create or open an existing notebook.
- <b>Functionality:</b> Used for experimentation, creating reports with code, and teaching Python efficiently.
- <b>Exporting:</b> Notebooks can be exported in various formats for sharing.
- <b>Cell Creation and Deletion:</b> Cells can be created with shift + enter and deleted with command mode + dd.
- <b>Entering Code:</b> Click inside a cell to enter edit mode and start typing Python code.
- <b>Running Code</b>: Execute code by holding shift and pressing enter.
- <b>Adding Cells:</b> Use keyboard shortcuts A or B in command mode to add cells above or below.
- <b>Markdown Cells:</b> Created with M in command mode, used for adding text, titles, and math equations.


Variables and Types
----------------------------
- Variables are basic units of programs, assigned values with equal sign.
- Jupyter Notebook shortcuts: Shift + Enter to run cells, 'a' to insert new cell.
- Variable naming rules: No starting with numbers, lowercase tradition.
- Variable types include integers, floats, complex numbers, strings, and booleans.
- String concatenation uses plus sign; cannot add strings and numbers.
- Error messages offer helpful information for debugging.

Data Structures
----------------------------
- Data structures allow for the storage of a list of values in a single variable.
- a list can contain any data type, including a list within a list
- The length of a list can be determined using the length function.
- A set is similar to a list, except it only contains unique elements and is declared using curly braces. 

Operators
---------------------------
- Operators are instructions that perform operations on variables and values in Python.
- They are used to manipulate and perform actions on data.
- eg. 1 + 1 // Output will be 2 


Control Flow
-----------------------------
- The if statement is one of the three main types of control flow in programming, and it allows you to execute a block of code only if a certain condition is met.
- In Python, you use the if statement like this: "a = True, if a: print It is true." 
> If the condition is true, the indented code under the if statement will be executed.

Functions
-------------------------------
-  is like a machine that takes inputs and produces outputs.
- functions can be defined using the "def" keyword followed by the function name and arguments in parentheses.
- the "return" keyword is used to specify the output.

Classes and Objects
--------------------------------
- When we define a class, we use an uppercase letter for the class name, and we start defining all the functions and attributes inside the class definition. 
- use 'self' as 'this' property


Ints and Floats
----------------------------------
